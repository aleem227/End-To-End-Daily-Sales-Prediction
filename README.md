# End-To-End ML Production ready Daily Sales Prediction

Develop a real-time sales prediction system for an e-commerce platform that predicts daily sales for various products. The system will utilize historical sales data, product information, and external factors such as weather and holidays to make accurate predictions. The model will be deployed to the cloud, containerized using Docker, and will have continuous training capabilities.

2. Data Sources
SQL Database: Historical sales data, product details, customer information.
API: External factors such as weather data, public holidays, and social media trends.

4. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
Extract: Fetch data from the SQL database and APIs.
Transform: Clean, normalize, and preprocess the data. Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering.
Load: Store the transformed data in a data warehouse or cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).

6. Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and relationships.
Feature engineering to create meaningful features (e.g., moving averages, promotional effects, seasonality).

8. Model Building
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train multiple models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and evaluate their performance.
Select the best model based on evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

10. Model Deployment
Containerize the model using Docker.
Deploy the container to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
Set up an API endpoint for real-time predictions using Flask or FastAPI.

12. Continuous Training
Implement a pipeline for continuous model training using new data.
Automate the retraining process using tools like Airflow or Jenkins.
Monitor model performance and update the model in production as needed.

14. Monitoring and Maintenance
Set up logging and monitoring to track model performance and system health.
Implement alerts for any anomalies or performance degradation.
Regularly update the system with new data and retrained models.

# Detailed Steps

Step 1: Data Extraction
Connect to the SQL database to extract historical sales data.
Use APIs to fetch weather data (e.g., OpenWeather API), public holidays (e.g., Calendarific API), and social media trends (e.g., Twitter API).

Step 2: Data Transformation
Clean the data: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct data types.
Normalize numerical features and encode categorical features.
Create new features: Moving averages, sales lag features, promotional flags, holiday indicators, etc.

Step 3: Data Loading
Store the transformed data in a cloud-based data warehouse (e.g., Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery).

Step 4: Data Analysis
Perform EDA using tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Visualize data distributions, correlations, and trends.
Identify key features impacting sales.

Step 5: Model Training
Use scikit-learn, XGBoost, and other libraries to train and evaluate models.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Select the best-performing model.

Step 6: Model Deployment
Write a REST API using Flask or FastAPI to serve the model.
Dockerize the application and model.
Deploy the Docker container to a cloud platform using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
Set up load balancing and autoscaling.

Step 7: Continuous Training
Create a pipeline to automate data fetching, transformation, and model retraining.
Use Apache Airflow or Jenkins to schedule and manage the pipeline.
Continuously monitor model performance and update the model as needed.

Step 8: Monitoring and Maintenance
Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
Set up logging with ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a cloud-based solution like AWS CloudWatch.
Regularly review system performance and make necessary adjustments.
